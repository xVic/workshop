== Workshop scaffolding

icon:hand-o-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

The workshop folder containing the code is already in your CRW, at the root of the filesystem.

In this workshop you will be developing an application dealing with Super Heroes (and Super Villains ðŸ¦¹).
The code will be in the super-heroes directory:

[plantuml]
----
@startsalt
{
{
T
quarkus-workshop-super-heroes
+ super-heroes         | The entire Super Hero application
}
}
@endsalt
----

=== Super Heroes Application

Under the `super-heroes` directory you will find the entire Super Hero application spread throughout a set of subdirectories, each one containing a microservice or some tooling.
The final structure will be the following:

[plantuml]
----
@startsalt
{
{
T
quarkus-workshop-super-heroes
+ super-heroes
++ infrastructure          | All the needed infrastructure (Postgres, Kafka...)
++ load-super-heroes       | Stress tool loading heroes, villains and fights
++ rest-fight              | REST API allowing super heroes to fight (you will create it)
++ rest-hero               | REST API for CRUD operations on Heroes (you will create it)
++ rest-villain            | REST API for CRUD operations on Villains
++ ui-super-heroes         | Angular application so we can fight visually
}
}
@endsalt
----

Most of theses subdirectories are Maven projects and follow the Maven directory structure:

[plantuml]
----
@startsalt
{
{
T
quarkus-workshop-super-heroes
+  super-heroes
++ rest-hero
+++ src
++++  main
+++++  docker
+++++  java
+++++  resources
++++  test
+++++  java
}
}
@endsalt
----

For next steps, you need to be authenticated on OpenShift with your own user

[source,shell]
----
$ oc login ....
$ oc project USERNAME-heroes
----

NOTE: change USERNAME with your own.

== Databases

Any microservice system is going to rely on a set of technical services.
In our context, we are going to use PostgreSQL as the database.
The infrastructure folder contains the OpenShift manifests to create the OpenShift resources in order to have this technical service available.
We need to create a database for each microservice: heroes, villains and fights.
The OpenShift manifests describing them can be found under `quarkus-workshop-super-heroes/super-heroes/infrastructure/` directory.

We can deploy the DBs easily using `oc` utility and the manifests from the CRW terminal.
Make sure that you are authenticated with your USERNAME and you are using the `USERNAME-heroes` namespace, then `apply` the databases yaml file:

[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f quarkus-workshop-super-heroes/super-heroes/infrastructure/databases.yaml
----

You can verify the availability of databases with the following command:
[source,shell]
----
curl http://heroes-database.USERNAME-heroes:5432
----
You should have the following response:

----
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
----


== Warming up Maven

Now that you have the initial structure in place, we just need configure the correct url for the database.

On your CRW, edit the `quarkus-workshop-super-heroes/super-heroes/rest-villain/src/main/resources/application.properties` file and change database configuration. You need to change DB's URL:

----
quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://villains-database.USERNAME-heroes:5432/villains_database
----

NOTE: Change USERNAME with your own.

Now, in the Terminal, you can navigate to the root directory `quarkus-workshop-super-heroes/` and run:

icon:hand-o-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#


[source,shell]
----
mvn clean install
----

By running this command, it downloads all the required dependencies.

== Ready?

Prerequisites has been installed, the different components have been warmed up,  it's now time to write some code!
